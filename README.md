## Context(directly copy pasted from kaggle):

They say age is just a number but a whole host of health issues come with aging. From heart disease and dementia to hearing loss and arthritis, aging is a risk factor for numerous diseases and complications. The growing field of bioinformatics includes research into interventions that can help slow and reverse biological aging and prevent major age-related ailments. Data science could have a role to play in developing new methods to solve problems with diverse data, even if the number of samples is small.

Currently, models like XGBoost and random forest are used to predict medical conditions yet the models' performance is not good enough. Dealing with critical problems where lives are on the line, models need to make correct predictions reliably and consistently between different cases.

Founded in 2015, competition host InVitro Cell Research, LLC (ICR) is a privately funded company focused on regenerative and preventive personalized medicine. Their offices and labs in the greater New York City area offer state-of-the-art research space. InVitro Cell Research's Scientists are what set them apart, helping guide and defining their mission of researching how to repair aging people fast.

In this competition, you’ll work with measurements of health characteristic data to solve critical problems in bioinformatics. Based on minimal training, you’ll create a model to predict if a person has any of three medical conditions, with an aim to improve on existing methods.

You could help advance the growing field of bioinformatics and explore new methods to solve complex problems with diverse data.

## Experiements
The following performance are done on stratified train test(based on target) split with 20% test size.
In the description, it's being mentioned that XGBoost are previously used to predict medical conditions, so I will use that model as a control.



Using PCA: </br>
Logistic regression = 0.91 </br>
SVM = 0.86 </br>
XGBoost = 0.59 </br>
 </br> </br>

Without PCA:
Logistic regression = 0.79
<\br>
SVM = 0.80
<\br>
XGBoost = 0.59 </br>
